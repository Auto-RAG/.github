There are many RAG pipelines and modules out there,
but you don‚Äôt know what pipeline is great for ‚Äúyour own data‚Äù and "your own use-case."
Making and evaluating all RAG modules is very time-consuming and hard to do.
But without it, you will never know which RAG pipeline is the best for your own use-case.

AutoRAG is a tool for finding the optimal RAG pipeline for ‚Äúyour data.‚Äù
You can evaluate various RAG modules automatically with your own evaluation data
and find the best RAG pipeline for your own use-case.

AutoRAG supports a simple way to evaluate many RAG module combinations.
Try now and find the best RAG pipeline for your own use-case.
